# cachu-slider

[![DUB](https://img.shields.io/dub/l/vibe-d.svg?style=for-the-badge)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A standalone vanilla javascript library to create animated fullscreen or content-fit sliders on your web pages. It is inspired by the famous library [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullpage.js/) by Alvaro Trigo.
<p>
The particularity of <code>cachu-slider</code> is that it's essentially based on Promises (ES6 feature), what is ideal for adding individual animations/transitions to each element of each slider section.
</p>

<p>
<b>Notice</b>: If you don't plan to use animations or transitions on some of the elements of some of your slides, you must ask yourself if you really need to use this library. ( You could consider using <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullpage.js/">fullpage.js</a> rather ).

## Usage
### 1. Including the library
Install via npm  : ```npm install cachu-slider``` <br>
Or include ```dist``` files directly into your HTML document.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="cachu-slider.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="cachu-slider.min.js"></script>
```
If you plan to use the library into a webpack project, you must read our [advanced guide](https://github.com/mystroken/cachu-slider/wiki/Include-cachu-slider-to-your-project) for including necessary files.

### 2. Required HTML Structure

```html
<div class="cachu__container">

  <!-- All sections are wrapped inside .cachu__sections  -->

  <div class="cachu__sections">
    <section class="cachu__section">Some section</section>
    <section class="cachu__section">Some section</section>
    <section class="cachu__section">Some section</section>
  </div>

  <!-- End of section  -->
  <!-- Navigation fill be dynamically added here (via JavaScript) -->
</div>
```
Each section will be defined with an element containing the ```cachu__section``` class. The active section by default will be the first section.

Slider elements should be placed inside a wrapper. The wrapper can not be the body element and it must have the ```cachu__container``` class.

This structure will generate, by default, a fullpage slider. If you want a content-fit slider rather, you should add to the wrapper ```cachu__container--content-fit``` class too.

```<div class="cachu__container cachu__container--content-fit">```


### 3. Instantiate the slider
Before initializing the slider, make sure that the DOM Content is already loaded.
```javascript
//
// Now let's turn on our slider!
//
// 1. Set some options.
// 2. Instantiate the Slider with the DOM Element instance of the wrapper.
// 3. Run the slider !!

const options = {};
let slider = new Cachu(document.querySelector('.cachu__container'), options);
slider.run();
```
A more complete initialization with all options set could look like this:
```javascript
// Complete options.
const options = {
  disableMouseEvents: false, // Disable mousewheel event listening.
  scrollingSpeed: 1000,  // The speed of the transition.
  scrollingLoop: true,  // Loop after reaching the end.
  navigationEnabled: true, // Enable navigation buttons
  navigationPosition: 'right'  // The Navigation's position
};

let slider = new Cachu(document.querySelector('.cachu__container'), options);
slider.run();
```

## Options
- ```disableMouseEvents```: *boolean* (default ```false```) Disable listening mousewheel events. This feature may be interesting if you only want to scroll through navigation buttons.
- ```scrollingSpeed```: *int* (default ```1000```) Sets the speed of the transition between sections. This value must be greather than or equal to zero (>= 0).
* ```scrollingLoop```: *boolean* (default ```true```) Tells the slider if it has to loop the scrolling after reaching the end of sections.
* ```navigationEnabled```: *boolean* (default ```true```) Tells the slider to display or not the navigation buttons.
* ```navigationPosition```: *string* (default ```right```) Sets the position of the navigation (if enabled). Possible values are:
	- ```top```: Fix navigation to the top.
	- ```right```: Fix navigation to the right.
	- ```bottom```: Fix navigation to the bottom.
	- ```left```: Fix navigation to the left.
## Methods
After instantiating the slider (```var slider = new Cachu(...)```), you get access to all these methods:
### run()
You must call this method to run the slide. Else, the content will be hidden.
